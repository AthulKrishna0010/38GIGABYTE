Great question! Since you're **Noel**, and now that you're using an external **OCR API** instead of training your own Colab model, here's how we can **refactor your and Tushar’s roles** to keep the work efficient, balanced, and productive.

---

## ✅ REVISED TEAM RESPONSIBILITIES

---

### 👨‍💻 Noel – *Node.js + React Frontend + API Integration*
You’re now the **core builder of the app**, responsible for all logic, user interface, and data flow.

#### 🎯 Updated Task List:

#### 📦 Backend (Node.js)
- [x] Set up Express server
- [ ] Handle file upload via `multer`
- [ ] Send uploaded image to the **external OCR API**
- [ ] Receive structured data or raw text
- [ ] Save the result to MongoDB
- [ ] Expose `GET /api/bills` to show past uploads

#### 💻 Frontend (React)
- [ ] Build the Upload Page (`UploadForm`)
  - Let user select image
  - Show loading spinner while waiting
- [ ] On success, display extracted info in `BillCard`
- [ ] Build a History Page to show previous uploads from DB

---

### 🧠 Tushar – *OCR API Testing + Data Cleaning + Prompt Engineering*
With the OCR API doing the heavy lifting, Tushar can take on **support and enhancement tasks**:

#### 🔍 Testing the OCR API
- [ ] Upload multiple bill types to test API performance
- [ ] Note if it returns:
  - ✅ Fully structured output
  - ❌ Raw text (needs formatting)

#### 🧼 Data Cleaning (if API returns unstructured/raw text)
- [ ] Create **prompt templates** (OpenAI/Gemini) to convert raw text into:
```json
{
  "vendor": "...",
  "date": "...",
  "total": "...",
  "tax": "..."
}
```

#### 🧠 Bonus Role
- [ ] Create fallback Colab model in case OCR API fails
- [ ] Research additional AI tools that enhance bill processing

## ⚙️ Project Flow (Now)

A[User uploads bill (React)] --> B[Backend receives file (Node)]
B --> C[Node sends image to OCR API]
C --> D[OCR API returns extracted data]
D --> E[Node saves to MongoDB]
E --> F[Frontend fetches + shows in UI]
```

## 📌 Summary of the Shift

| Responsibility | Before | After |
|----------------|--------|-------|
| Bill Text Extraction | Tushar (Colab) | Done by external OCR API |
| Text to JSON Structuring | Tushar (OpenAI) | Optional fallback |
| Backend + React UI | Noel | ✅ Still yours |
| Data Cleanup + Testing | Tushar | ✅ New primary focus |
